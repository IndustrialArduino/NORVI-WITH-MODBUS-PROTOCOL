In this document, we will explore the process of NORVI acting as a MODBUS slave. 
We'll focus on the interaction between the NORVI device and Simply MODBUS Master software.
Examining how to read the digital inputs, and analog input and storing the values in the Modbus Software, and the relay/transistor outputs are controlled from the Modbus software.
