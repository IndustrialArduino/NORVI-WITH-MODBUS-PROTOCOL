In this document, we will explore the process of NORVI acting as a MODBUS master. 
We'll focus on the interaction between the NORVI device and Simply MODBUS Slave software.
Examining how to read the values of the digital inputs, analog inputs, and relay/transistor outputs from the MODBUS Software and storing the values in the NORVI device.
